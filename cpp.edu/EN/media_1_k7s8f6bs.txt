        Lea Dominguez (24', aerospace engineering) was overwhelmed. Early in her college experience at Cal Poly Pomona, she had unexpectedly gotten pregnant around the same time she finished her first set of extremely challenging aerospace engineering classes.  

 

But she didn't give up on her dream. She reached out for support at CPP and found mentors with whom she established a deep bond. In the end, her grit and determination won out and she walked across the commencement stage in 2024 into a career she always dreamed about.
